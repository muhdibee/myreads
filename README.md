# MyReads Project

This app helps you categorize your books into shelfs/categories namely: Currently reading, Want to read and Read. It also allows you to add a book to your shelf by searching using the book title or the author.


To see the app in action:
* clone the repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
